..is a arduino based distance meter tool <br> with 4 distance sensors looks "up", "down", left and right, to help positioning things on the wall (e.g.: picture frames) or on the floor.

[The original idea found on this video.](https://youtu.be/QvjQSEvRNkw)

### Planned features:

 - Simple distance measurement
 - Measure distance in 2 opposite side (can delect direction [left-right / up-down])
 - Positioning: continously show the distance values in real time (measure from middle hole or from the side)
