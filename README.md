# DIY-helper
..is a arduino based distance meter tool <br> with 4 distance sensors looks "up", "down", left and right, to help positioning things on the wall (e.g.: picture frames) or on the floor.

[The original idea found on this video.](https://youtu.be/QvjQSEvRNkw)

### Planned features:

 - Simple distance measurement
 - Measure distance in 2 opposite side (can select direction [left-right / up-down])
 - Positioning: continously show the distance values in real time (measure from middle hole or from the side)

### ToDo list:
- [ ] Clarify / finalyze planned features
- [ ] Create schematic according to the planned features (e.g.: count of push-buttons)
- [ ] Finalyze part-list and buy missing parts (if there any)
- [ ] Create test circuits on bread-boards for handling multiple buttons on 1 ADC input
- [ ] Try out multiple buttons in 1 ADC line
- [ ] Create plans for "UI"
- [ ] Create test circuits on bread-boards for complete project
